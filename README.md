# ps-spring-boot-resources
This repository contains resources to help developers build Spring Boot applications.  T
## Resources
This project contains 2 resource types.  An angular web client and some server side Java resources.

### Web Client
The angular web client included in this project is based off of the 'angular-bootstrap-starter' located here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-bootstrap-starter

The built angular project is located in 'client/www' and can be copied directly to your Spring Boot app and used as is.  If you prefer to build the angular client using Gulp, follow the angular-bootstrap-starter instructions located on their web page or you can view the readme file at 'client/README.md' in this project.

### Java Resources
To speed up having to code non Spring Boot related parts of this application, several Java classes are located in the 'java' folder of this project.  If you are following along on the pluralsight course, the course will direct you where to place each of these files at the appropriate time.
